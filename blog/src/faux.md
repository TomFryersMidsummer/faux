# faux

**faux** is a library to create [mocks] out of structs.

With faux you can stub the behavior of your structs during tests, thus
allowing you to write readable and maintainable unit tests.

> Mocking is a powerful technique to write repeatable **unit**
> tests. Mocks let you focus on a particular system or component by
> mocking the dependencies underneath that may be hard or not valuable
> to setup in your unit tests. These kind of tests are not meant to
> replace higher level tests that would verify the correctness of your
> application as a whole.

This book is split into two sections: a guide for using faux, and an
appendix of blog posts regarding faux.
